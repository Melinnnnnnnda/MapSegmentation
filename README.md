# MapSegmentation
This repository performs segmentation of historical maps based on three models: FCN, UNet, and Segformer. You can start with **main.py**, which performs the training of model UNet or FCN. If your model is Segformer, you can use **segformer.py** instead. After training, the model parameters will be stored under folder **model**. You can then use **reconstruct.py** to restore the whole image from the model parameters. **Draw.py** allows you to compare the performance of the three models.
